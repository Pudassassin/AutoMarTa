Proposal : A game to teach programming.

[Requirements]
  A: How to teach?

  B: Programming Lessons
    PL-T1: Structured (Sequential, "classic")
      1.0 concepts
      1.1 Program Structure
        * visualize common used code blocks / structures
        + log "Hello, world!"
        + basic function (usage)
      1.2 Variable Declaration
        + variable type
        + arithmetic
        ++ array (static sized)
        ++ structure
      1.3 Looping Structures
        + for loop
        + while loop (do-while/while-do)
      1.4 Control Structures
        + if-else
        + switch-case
      1.5 Syntax [?, since we use block/flow chart]

    PL-T2: Object-Oriented Programming

  C: Game Design (Detailed version is in separated file -> Game Design)
    GDD-1 Overviews
      Working Title: "Auto-Mar-Ta"
      Concept :   An RTS/automation game to introduce player to concepts of programming.
      Theme :     Sci-fi
      Setting :   Mars Expandation (+ first E.T. encounter/ Mars disaster)
      Genre :     RTS + Automation (+ Management?)
